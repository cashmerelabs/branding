# Cashmere Brand + Landing Guide

## Core One-Liner
Autonomous Monetary Infrastructure: the stablecoin super app to move, earn, and settle at the best rate everywhere.

## Positioning
 Stablecoin super app (mobility, yield, privacy, on/off-ramps) delivered as one infrastructure layer.

## Narrative Spine (use across site, decks, ads)
1) Fragmentation is costly: bridges fragment liquidity, add slippage, and expose risk.  
2) Autonomous layer: Cashmere unifies mobility, yield and ramps in one programmable fabric.  
3) Proof today: zero-slippage transfers live; gas ≈150k on EVM; 8–20s finality; no wrapped assets.  
4) What it unlocks: stablecoin treasuries move, earn, and settle privately across any chain from one app.  

## Voice & Tone
- Confident, technical, efficient; never hypey.
- Lead with outcomes (best rate, zero slippage), then the mechanism (native burn-and-mint, relayers).
- Keep sentences short; prefer verbs over adjectives; avoid jargon unless it proves precision (CCTP, USDT0).

## Copy Blocks (ready-to-use)
- Hero H1: “Autonomous Monetary Infrastructure”  
- Hero H2: “Move, earn, and settle at the best rate always.”
- Supporting line: “If you hold a stablecoin, Cashmere moves it cross-chain with zero slippage, allocates yield autonomously, and makes on/off ramps one click.”
- Pillar titles: Mobility (zero-slippage transfers), Autonomy (yield agents), Privacy (zk settlement), Access (on/off ramps).
- Proof bullets: “0.00% slippage; ≈150k gas; 8–20s finality; no wrapped assets.”

## Landing Page Structure (above the fold to footer)
- Hero: One-liner + stablecoin super app framing; primary CTA; secondary CTA to docs.
- Credibility strip: issuer/alignment logos (Circle CCTP, USDT0) and supported chains (ETH, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, Sui, Aptos…).
- Product pillars (4-up): Mobility, Autonomy, Privacy, Access with one-sentence outcomes.
- “Best Rate, Every Chain”: explain zero slippage, deterministic outputs, and why native minting beats market-maker routes.
- How it works (4 steps): Quote → Source Stablecoin Burn → Attest → Destination Stablecoin Mint (single transaction UX).
- Use cases (tiles): Treasuries, Fintech wallets, DeFi teams, Institutions (privacy/compliance).
- Performance cards: gas (≈150k), speed (8–20s), slippage (0.00%), architecture (native burn-and-mint vs wrapped).
- Roadmap/status: Bridge (Production), Yield Agents (Closed testnet), Privacy (Research), Gate (Research).

## Visual Identity (directions for designer)
- Logo concept: clean wordmark + abstract “flow ring” or interlocking arcs to signal native mint/burn loops; avoid crypto clichés (chains/locks). Works in solid, outline, and monochrome.
- Palette (modern finance, high contrast):  
  - Midnight navy `#0B1C2C` (trusty base)  
  - Glacier white `#F6F9FC` (clean surfaces)  
  - Electric teal `#22D1BD` (system intelligence highlight)  
  - Signal amber `#FFB74D` (callouts/alerts)  
  - Slate `#5A6B7A` (body text)
- Typography: geometric sans for headings (e.g., “Space Grotesk”/“Satoshi”), humanist sans for body (e.g., “Manrope”/“Source Sans 3”). Tight leading, modest tracking; all-caps for micro-labels only.
- Imagery: system diagrams, minimal line illustrations of flows; avoid stock lifestyle. Use gradients sparingly (navy → deep teal) to hint at depth.

## Logo & Usage Guardrails
- Clearspace = half the x-height around the mark; minimum size to keep counters open.
- Primary lockup: dark on light; use white on navy for dark sections.
- Avoid bevels/shadows; no drop-shadows on logomark. Keep stroke weights consistent between arcs/wordmark.
- Favicon: simplified arc/loop; maintain recognizability at 16×16.

## Design DNA (patterns, motion, UI cues)
- Patterns: thin arcs/paths converging to a single node (represents “one-click mint”), dotted grids for data.
- Motion: purposeful—hero load uses a left-to-right “mint” sweep; button hover adds 2–3px glow in teal; section reveals stagger by 80–120ms.
- Components: high-contrast buttons (teal on navy or navy on white), cards with subtle inset borders (`1px` slate, `6px` radius).

## Audience-Specific Messages
- Treasuries/Enterprises: “Deterministic transfers, policy controls, and selective disclosure when you need auditability.”
- Wallets/Fintechs: “Single SDK for cross-chain send/receive at the best rate—no liquidity ops or market-makers.”
- Builders: “Contract and API suite: quote, transfer, monitor; ERC-4337 smart accounts for automation.”
- Institutions: “Privacy with compliance hooks (selective disclosure) and unified on/off ramps in one flow.”

## Quick Proof Points (for callouts, ads)
- Zero slippage; native burn-and-mint, no wrapped assets.
- ≈150k gas on EVM; 8s (L2) / 20s (L1) execution.
- Coverage: EVM, Solana, Aptos, Sui
- Automation: guaranteed relayer-signed quotes; MEV-resistant deterministic outputs.

## Do / Don’t
- Do: Lead with “Autonomous Monetary Infrastructure” and “best rate, every chain.” Pair every claim with a mechanism (native mint, relayers, policy engine).
- Don’t: Show wrapped tokens, token logos in isolation, or imply custody of user funds. Avoid generic “bridge” language without the autonomous angle.
